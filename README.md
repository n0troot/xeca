# xeca
xeca is a project that creates encrypted PowerShell payloads for offensive purposes.

Creating position independent shellcode from DLL files is also possible.

Note: Please place your custom AMSI bypass in `src/assets/amsi-bypass.ps1`.

## Install
Firstly ensure that rust is [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then build the project with the following command:
```
cargo build
```

## How It Works
1. Identify and encrypt the payload. Load encrypted payload into a powershell script and save to a file named "launch.txt"
3. The key to decrypt the payload is saved to a file named "safe.txt"
3. Execute "launch.txt" on a remote host
   - The script will call back to the attacker defined web server to retrieve the decryption key "safe.txt"
   - Decrypt the payload in memory
   - Execute the intended payload in memory

## Mitigations
If users must have access to programs such as powershell.exe, consider minimising security risks with [Just Enough Administration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/overview?view=powershell-7) and [PowerShell Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/wmf/whats-new/script-logging?view=powershell-7). Application control policies can be deployed via a whitelisting technology such as [AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview).
